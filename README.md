## About Kirisa

Kirisa is the proposed company name behind this project. The name is inspired by the idea of global connectivity, symbolizing commerce from the first sunrise to the last. The concept draws inspiration from Kiribati, one of the first places in the world to witness sunrise, and extends to regions that experience the last sunrise, representing a complete global cycle.

Kirisa reflects the core vision of the project — connecting India and the world through a unified cross-border marketplace that enables transparent, affordable, and accessible international commerce. The name emphasizes inclusivity, global reach, and seamless connectivity across borders.

##  Overview

Many products that are popular globally are not available in India, and at the same time, many authentic Indian products never reach international buyers.

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a marketplace where users can easily discover products across borders, understand the full cost upfront, and buy with confidence.

##  Problem Statement

Cross-border shopping faces several real-world challenges:

Many global brands and niche products are not officially available in India

Many Indian products are not listed or promoted on foreign platforms

High international shipping costs make small orders expensive

Customs duties and taxes are unclear until delivery

Buyers often face surprise charges and delays

Because of these issues, users either avoid cross-border shopping or rely on informal and unreliable methods.
