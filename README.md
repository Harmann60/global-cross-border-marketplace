# Global Cross-Border Marketplace Platform

**A platform that simplifies cross-border product discovery between India and the rest of the world, making hard-to-find products accessible with transparent pricing.**

---

##  Overview

Many products that are popular globally are not available in India, and at the same time, many authentic Indian products never reach international buyers.

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a marketplace where users can easily discover products across borders, understand the full cost upfront, and buy with confidence.

##  Problem Statement

Cross-border shopping faces several real-world challenges:

Many global brands and niche products are not officially available in India

Many Indian products are not listed or promoted on foreign platforms

High international shipping costs make small orders expensive

Customs duties and taxes are unclear until delivery

Buyers often face surprise charges and delays

Because of these issues, users either avoid cross-border shopping or rely on informal and unreliable methods.
