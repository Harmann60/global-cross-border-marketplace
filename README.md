# 🌍 Global Cross-Border Marketplace Platform

> **A platform that simplifies cross-border product discovery between India and the rest of the world, making hard-to-find products accessible with transparent pricing.**

---

## 📌 Overview

Many products that are popular globally are not available in India, and at the same time, many authentic Indian products never reach international buyers. 

This project aims to bridge that gap by creating a marketplace where users can easily discover products across borders, understand the full cost upfront, and buy with confidence.

## ❗ Problem Statement

Cross-border shopping currently faces several real-world challenges:

* **Limited Availability:** Many global brands and niche products are not officially available in India, and Indian products are not listed on foreign platforms.
* **High Shipping Costs:** International shipping for small orders is often prohibitively expensive.
* **Lack of Transparency:** Customs duties and taxes are unclear until delivery, leading to surprise charges.
* **Trust Issues:** Buyers often face delays and rely on informal, unreliable methods to get products.

**Result:** Users avoid cross-border shopping due to friction and uncertainty.
